# staffrender
A plain vanilla TypeScrip library to render music score in browsers

It has been created to support Tensorflow/Magenta-JS staff visualizer, but it could be used standalone.

This is a **work in process** project, who has some to do list, like triplets, quintuplets and shorter-than-quarter notes aggregation into beams (instead individual note flags), but it is fully operative. It will keep on growing and evolving. NPM packaging deserves some cleanup as well, and some stand alone demos will be offered (currently focused on magenta-js consumption demos).
