 * Draw is useful for synchronizing visuals and audio events.
 * Callbacks from Tone.Transport or any of the Tone.Event classes
 * always happen _before_ the scheduled time and are not synchronized
 * to the animation frame so they are not good for triggering tightly
 * synchronized visuals and sound. Draw makes it easy to schedule
 * callbacks using the AudioContext time and uses requestAnimationFrame.
 * @example
 * Tone.Transport.schedule((time) => {
 * 	// use the time argument to schedule a callback with Draw
 * 	Tone.Draw.schedule(() => {
 * 		// do drawing or DOM manipulation here
 * 		console.log(time);
 * 	}, time);
 * }, "+0.5");
 * Tone.Transport.start();
