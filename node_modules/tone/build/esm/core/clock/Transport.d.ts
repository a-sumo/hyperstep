 * you're scheduling. <br><br>
 * A single transport is created for you when the library is initialized.

 * The transport emits the events: "start", "stop", "pause", and "loop" which are
 * called with the time of that event as the argument.

 * const osc = new Tone.Oscillator().toDestination();
 * // repeated event every 8th note
 * Tone.Transport.scheduleRepeat((time) => {
 * 	// use the callback time to schedule events
 * 	osc.start(time).stop(time + 0.1);
