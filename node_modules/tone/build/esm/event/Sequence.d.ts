 * A sequence is an alternate notation of a part. Instead

 * in an array of events which will be spaced at the
 * given subdivision. Sub-arrays will subdivide that beat
 * by the number of items are in the array.
 * Sequence notation inspiration from [Tidal](http://yaxu.org/tidal/)
 * @example
 * const synth = new Tone.Synth().toDestination();
 * const seq = new Tone.Sequence((time, note) => {
 * 	synth.triggerAttackRelease(note, 0.1, time);
 * 	// subdivisions are given as subarrays
 * }, ["C4", ["E4", "D4", "E4"], "G4", ["A4", "G4"]]).start(0);
 * Tone.Transport.start();
