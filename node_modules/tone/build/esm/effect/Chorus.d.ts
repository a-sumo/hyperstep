/**
 * Chorus is a stereo chorus effect composed of a left and right delay with an [[LFO]] applied to the delayTime of each channel.
 * When [[feedback]] is set to a value larger than 0, you also get Flanger-type effects.
 * Inspiration from [Tuna.js](https://github.com/Dinahmoe/tuna/blob/master/tuna.js).
 * Read more on the chorus effect on [SoundOnSound](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/synthsecrets.htm).
 *
 * @example
 * const chorus = new Tone.Chorus(4, 2.5, 0.5).toDestination().start();
 * const synth = new Tone.PolySynth().connect(chorus);
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease(["C3", "E3", "G3"], "8n");
