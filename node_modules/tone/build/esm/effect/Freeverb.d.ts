 * Freeverb is a reverb based on [Freeverb](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html).

 * Freeverb is now implemented with an AudioWorkletNode which may result on performance degradation on some platforms. Consider using [[Reverb]].
 * @example
 * const freeverb = new Tone.Freeverb().toDestination();
 * freeverb.dampening = 1000;
 * // routing synth through the reverb
 * const synth = new Tone.NoiseSynth().connect(freeverb);
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease(0.05);
