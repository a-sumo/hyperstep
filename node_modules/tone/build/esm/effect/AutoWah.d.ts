 * AutoWah connects a [[Follower]] to a [[Filter]].

 *
 * @example
 * const autoWah = new Tone.AutoWah(50, 6, -30).toDestination();
 * // initialize the synth and connect to autowah
 * const synth = new Tone.Synth().connect(autoWah);
 * // Q value influences the effect of the wah - default is 2
 * autoWah.Q.value = 6;
 * // more audible on higher notes
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n");
