/**
 * A wrapper around the MediaRecorder API. Unlike the rest of Tone.js, this module does not offer
 * any sample-accurate scheduling because it is not a feature of the MediaRecorder API.
 * This is only natively supported in Chrome and Firefox.
 * For a cross-browser shim, install (audio-recorder-polyfill)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-recorder-polyfill].
 * @example
 * const recorder = new Tone.Recorder();
 * const synth = new Tone.Synth().connect(recorder);
 * // start recording
 * recorder.start();
 * // generate a few notes
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease("C3", 0.5);
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", 0.5, "+1");
 * synth.triggerAttackRelease("C5", 0.5, "+2");
 * // wait for the notes to end and stop the recording
 * setTimeout(async () => {
 * 	// the recorded audio is returned as a blob
 * 	const recording = await recorder.stop();
 * 	// download the recording by creating an anchor element and blob url
 * 	const url = URL.createObjectURL(recording);
 * 	const anchor = document.createElement("a");
 * 	anchor.download = "recording.webm";
 * 	anchor.href = url;
 * 	anchor.click();
 * }, 4000);
