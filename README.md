Process and Agent Based Music.
Through a series of interactive notebooks, I'll guide your through my attempt to generate music using physical processes and artificial agents.
## [Agent Self Regulation](https://github.com/a-sumo/hyperstep/blob/main/agent_self_regulation.ipynb)
  In this notebook, I attempt to recreate organic temporal patterns and syncopation by modeling the composition as an agent trying to regulate an internal property, similarly to homeostasis in real-world living agents. The agent performs this regulation through a set of actions each associated with a sound, and each having a specific effect over its internal properties.
 Here's is one of the model outputs:
